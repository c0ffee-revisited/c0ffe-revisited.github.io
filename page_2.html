    <h4>Glenn Bennie & Ricky Maymi Project - Untitled DEC22->JAN23</h4>
    <p>Overdubs. Tracks imported/created from/in Logic.</p>

    <P>Ricky used an Ebow on most tunes. 2x close mics (Royer 122 and an SM58) for alternate tones and 1x mic on the far side of the studio facing the glass capturing the only reflections available in the very dead tracking space. </P>

    <h4>Cambodian Space Project OCT22</h4>
    <p>Running 2x record sessions in RMIT's A studio and tagging along for a trip to Headgap with Julian and the gang.</p>
    <p><a href="https://cambodianspaceproject.org/">CSP</a> - <a href="https://www.headgap.com.au/">HeadGap</a></p>
    <img src="./docs/assets/images/CSP/CSP_Pauly.jpg" alt="CSP_NeveStudio"  width="711" height="450" >
    <img src="./docs/assets/images/CSP/CSP_HeadGap.gif" alt="CSP" width="700" height="440" >
    <p>Neve Genysis console and a some classic outboard gear into Protools, tracking all together live, isolating the bass and guitar to take tracks to HeadGap later that week for the Horns!</p>
    <p>A fave track was a dub groove about a giant snail making its way across a bar ខ្យងយក្ស ? The second record session had Julian ripping overdubs for nearly 8 hours straight. CSP's crazy schedule meant someone was napping whenever possible, usually in the control room with monitors up too.</p>
    <p>Sorry I missed the last weekend Julian and thanks again John! Was a great time. Alter ego <a href="https://instagram.com/paulycpaulydo">Pauly C on the scene.</a> </p>

    <h4>X-Aspirations @ The Tote SEP22</h4>
    <p>Another live multitrack recording for Craig Kember / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zenarcadeofficial/">Zen Arcade</a>. X played their album "Aspirations" in full for a coinciding 40th anniversary night.</p>

    <<img src="./docs/assets/images/X-aspirations/XGalaxy.jpg" alt="Soundcheck" width="1008" height="369" >
    <p>The house desk (Digico S21) had been re-patched locally earlier that day and Dazza's mic set-up was almost bare bones - so there weren't any luxuries left for the capture - however, the recordings came out sounding pretty nice, considering the sound coming off stage. See linked article for more.</p>
    <p>This was the last live capture using Protools into a macbookpro. While a wasted punter/dickhead critiqued Dazza's work, the unfounded negativity that made no dent on Daz found another way. At the very same moment, stopping record, an error popped up in tools and we lost the BV track. Sorry about that Craig!</p>
    <p>Tracks Live / Reaper has been much sturdier running from the macbook since.</p>

    <h4>ColourWheel - Test Run @ The Capitol SEP22</h4>
    <p>RMIT extra-curricular fun. Midnight Oil's Jim Moginie combines music and art in - 'The Colour Wheel', a guitar orchestra exploring the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia"> synesthesia </a>, putting the newly installed Capitol lighting system to use.</p>
    <p>In anticipation of this <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/arts/midnight-oils-jim-moginie-combines-music-and-art-in-the-colour-wheel/news-story/c86503e035d663e5bcad0d63becad897"> production</a> coming to <a href="https://thecapitol.tv/">The Capitol</a> in 2023, a group of eager volunteers helped staff to put on three dry-run shows to assess the productions viability/kinks/potential. </p>

    <p>Desk: Allen & Heath SQ6. 2x large subwoofers were brought in and we patched into the Capitol's PA system. Testing the system with pink noise and an RTA showed promising signs. 
       But when really pushed, the loud stage volume caused issues with the clarity of the performance. 
       The PA being set up through a Q-sys network was geared to accomodate lectures and speakers, and not so much orchestral rock <b>\m/,</b>.
       One run through was even performed without the PA, though a little underwhelming. Hopefully 2023 has a PA set-up brought in or the performers each bring a Fender Twin. </p>

    <h4>Nicole Halford & The Rose Limbs @ The Workers Club JUL22</h4>
    <p>Sound at the Workers. The big square concrete room doesn't sound great, <b>BUT</b> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NicoleHalfordandTheRoseLimbs/"> NicoleHalfordandTheRoseLimbs</a> sure did.</p>
