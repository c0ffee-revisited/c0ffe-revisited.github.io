                      <p>Work on the film included production in 5.1 @ RMIT Studios using Protools, foley recording, ADR, and creating sound design elements throughout the film. 
                        Initially drafting a rough mix for a test screening Tatiana ~ OCT, work on the film proper ramped up over christmas, after Tatiana's directors breif early DEC. 
                        Managing to run out of voices on our Protools system, we had to get creatively manage our tracks/buses/routing, making sure not to use native and DSP plugins on the same tracks, and keeping the session as clean as possible. 
                        Using all sound recordings provided by Sarah Tarr, some scenes required their audio completely built using recorded foley and sound design (Approaching office building + Walking up stairwell). Mixed by Andy Evans.</p>

                      <p>Ricky used an Ebow on most tunes to create thick drones / textures to pair with Glenn's material. I kept being reminded of The Pastels re-mix album <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/335014-The-Pastels-Illuminati-Pastels-Music-Remixed">'Illuminati'</a>, but noisier! Micing included 2x close mics used for alternate tones(Royer 122 and SM58), and 1x mic on the far side of the studio facing the glass capturing the only reflections available in the very dead tracking space. Glenn prodcued most of the sounds using Logic's basic tools/instruments/drummers, as well as a new Behringer synth/sequencer.<br>Songs headed to Simon Polinski for Mix/Master!

                      <h1>Cambodian Space Project (2022)</h1>
                      <p>The Cambodian Space Project (CSP) is recognised as one of the few truly Aussie Asian hybrids in contemporary music. Since 2009, it has been at the forefront of an astonishing cultural revival in Cambodia, since singer Channthy Kak & musician Julien Poulson teamed up in Phnom Penh, to sing back to life the lost divas & rock legends of Cambodia’s golden age of music, all but wiped out by the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime. The Cambodian Space Project sound is definitely for the 21st century, mashing tradition with rock’n’roll, rare groove, soul, & trippy visual spectacle. They perform re-imagined Khmer classics, alongside originals speaking of Cambodia today like Not Easy Rock’n’roll, Have Visa No Have Rice, and Whisky Cambodia.</p>
                      <p>Running 2x record sessions in RMIT's Neve studio and tagging along for a trip to Headgap with Julian Poulsen and the gang.</p>

                      <p>Neve Genesys console and a some classic outboard gear into Protools, tracking everyone together live, but isolating the bass and guitar as much as possible for later recording sessions at HeadGap Studios.</p>
                      <p>Look out for their ipcoming release. A favourite track was a dub groove about a giant snail making its way across the bar. The second record session had Julian ripping overdubs for nearly 8 hours straight. CSP's crazy schedule meant someone was napping whenever possible, usually in the control room with monitors up too.</p>
                      <p>Sorry I missed the last weekend Julian and thanks John! Was a great time. សូមអរគុណ!. Alter ego <a href="https://instagram.com/paulycpaulydo">Pauly C </a> on the scene.</p>

                      <p>Runnning a record session in RMIT's Neve studio with the band, getting tracks down for their upcoming album. With the usual suspects Kristjan and Paul. Recording everything through the Neve Genesys 1073 pre amps with little to no eq/comp, a very clean signal. And it sounded great. Request by Henry to record at 44.1kHz for a legacy version of Protools! Can't wait to hear it.</p>

                      <h1>X-Aspirations @ The Tote (2022)</h1>
                      <p>X-Aspirations was recorded in a single afternoon in 1979 at Trafalgar Studios in the band's hometown of Sydney and released the following year on the band's own label. In 2022, X were celebrating the 40th (ish?) anniversary of the classic album, “X-Aspirations”, playing the whole album in it's running order.</p>
                      <p>Another live multitrack recording for Craig Kember / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zenarcadeofficial/">Zen Arcade</a>. X played their album "Aspirations" in full for a coinciding Tote 40th anniversary night.</p>

                      <p>The house desk (Digico S21) had been re-patched locally earlier that day and Dazza's mic set-up was almost bare bones - so there weren't any luxuries left for the capture - however, the recordings came out sounding pretty nice, considering the sound coming off stage. See linked article for more.</p>
                      <p>This was the last live capture using Protools into a macbookpro. While a wasted punter/dickhead critiqued Dazza's work, the unfounded negativity that made no dent on Daz found another way. At the very same moment, stopping record, an error popped up in tools and we lost the BV track. Sorry about that Craig!</p>
                      <p>Tracks Live / Reaper has been much sturdier running from the macbook since.</p>

                      <h1>ColourWheel - Test Run @ The Capitol (2022)</h1>
                      <p>Jim Morginie: in THE COLOUR WHEEL, we explore the attempts over history to prove the 'connection' between music and colour - examine the art, music, and theories of Kandinsky, Klee, Schoenberg, and Bowral born artist Roy de Maistre. In the early years of the 20th century there were terrific advances in physics with the Special and General theories of Relativity and the advent of quantum mechanics, uncovering the very building blocks of matter which totally changed the way in which humans observed the world. Around the same time, a similar revolution took place in both Muisc and Art, along with a desire to deconstruct formality and structure. THE COLOUR WHEEL is performed by myself and an ensemble of electric guitar players and painters.</p>
                      <p>RMIT extra-curricular fun. Midnight Oil's Jim Moginie combines music and art in - 'The Colour Wheel', a guitar orchestra exploring the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia">synesthesia</a>, putting the newly installed Capitol lighting system to good use.</p>
                      <p>In anticipation of the <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/arts/midnight-oils-jim-moginie-combines-music-and-art-in-the-colour-wheel/news-story/c86503e035d663e5bcad0d63becad897">ColourWheel</a> coming to <a href="https://thecapitol.tv/">The Capitol</a> in 2023, a group of eager volunteers helped staff to put on three dry-run shows to assess the productions viability/kinks/potential.</p>

                      <p>Desk: Allen & Heath SQ6. 2x large subwoofers were brought in and we patched into the Capitol's PA system. Testing the system with pink noise and an RTA showed promise. 
                         But when pushed, the loud stage volume was causing problems. 
                         The PA being set up to recieve signal patched through a Q-sys network, was geared to accomodate lectures and speakers, and not so much a guitar orchestra <b>\m/,</b>.
                         A run through was even performed without any FOH, though a little underwhelming. Hopefully the future performance has a system brought in, with delays set-up to achieve proper coverage to the very high and far seating to the back of the theatre.</p>
