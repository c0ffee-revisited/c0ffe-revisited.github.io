    <h4>"The Job" DEC22->JAN23</h4>
    <p>Short film by <a href="https://tatianadoroshenko.com/">Tatiana Doroshenko</a></p>
    <p>Tatiana’s short films and screen works have seen audiences in Australia, Europe and America. Screening highlights include European Media Arts Festival (EMAF) 2007, VAD Spain 2006, Transmediale Berlin 2002, Aspen, Palm Springs (2007), the Santiago Biennale 2003, HollyShorts, MIFF and St Kilda Film Festival.</p>

    <p>Work on the film included Mixing in 5.1 @ RMIT Studios using Protools, foley recording, and creating sound design elements throughout. Initially drafting a very rough mix for Tatiana ~ OCT, work on the film ramped up over christmas, after Tatiana's directors breif mid DEC. We even managed to run out of voices on the Protools system! Choosing to get creative instead of bouncing tracks/buses down. Finding any stereo tracks heading to a mono source, making sure not to use native and DSP plugins on the same tracks.</p>

    <h4>Glenn Bennie & Ricky Maymi Project - Untitled DEC22->JAN23</h4>
    <p>Glenn Bennie of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_Lovers">undergroundLOVERS</a>, latest project collaborating with Ricky Maymi of <a href="https://thebrianjonestownmassacre.com/">BJM</a>.</p>
    <p>Running a studio session recording guitar overdubs. Tracks imported/created from/in Logic by Glenn.</p>

    <img src="./docs/assets/images/GlennAndRicky/PedalArray.jpg" alt="FuzzLoan" width="666" height="445" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
    <p>Ricky used an Ebow on most tunes to create waves of texture to pair with Glenn's tunes. I kept being reminded of the Pastels Re-mix album <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/335014-The-Pastels-Illuminati-Pastels-Music-Remixed">'Illuminati'</a>, but noisier. Micing included 2x close mics (Royer 122 and SM58) used for alternate tones, and 1x mic on the far side of the studio facing the glass capturing the only reflections available in the very dead tracking space. Songs headed to Simon Polinski for Mix/Master! Simons <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/236563-Simon-Polinski">Discogs</a> here.</p>

    <h4>Cambodian Space Project OCT22</h4>
    <p>The Cambodian Space Project (CSP) is recognised as one of the few truly Aussie Asian hybrids in contemporary music. Since 2009, it has been at the forefront of an astonishing cultural revival in Cambodia, since singer Channthy Kak & musician Julien Poulson teamed up in Phnom Penh, to sing back to life the lost divas & rock legends of Cambodia’s golden age of music, all but wiped out by the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime. The Cambodian Space Project sound is definitely for the 21st century, mashing tradition with rock’n’roll, rare groove, soul, & trippy visual spectacle. They perform re-imagined Khmer classics, alongside originals speaking of Cambodia today like Not Easy Rock’n’roll, Have Visa No Have Rice, and Whisky Cambodia.</p>
    <p>Running 2x record sessions in RMIT's A studio and tagging along for a trip to Headgap with Julian Poulsen and the gang.</p>

    <p>Neve Genesys console and a some classic outboard gear into Protools, tracking everyone together live, isolating the bass and guitar to take tracks to HeadGap later that week for the Horns!</p>
    <p>Look out for their ipcoming release A fave track was a dub groove about a giant snail making its way across a bar. The second record session had Julian ripping overdubs for nearly 8 hours straight. CSP's crazy schedule meant someone was napping whenever possible, usually in the control room with monitors up too.</p>
    <p>Sorry I missed the last weekend Julian and thanks John! Was a great time. សូមអរគុណ!. Alter ego <a href="https://instagram.com/paulycpaulydo">Pauly C </a> on the scene.</p>

    <p>Desk: Yamaha QL1. Capturing audio straight from the networked RIO3224-D2 stage box into Reaper. A bit of pre-production had to be done to get Dante Virtual Soundcard and Dante Controller playing along with the desk and then Reaper.</p>

    <h4>Henry Hugo And The Fallen Angels OCT22</h4>
    <p>Runnning a record session in RMIT's A studio with the band, getting tracks down for their upcoming album. With the usual suspects Kristjan and Paul. Recording everything through the Neve Genesys 1073 pre amps with little to no eq/comp, a very clean signal. And it sounded great. Request by Henry to record at 44.1kHz for a legacy version of Protools! Can't wait to hear it.</p>

    <h4>X-Aspirations @ The Tote SEP22</h4>
    <p>X-Aspirations was recorded in a single afternoon in 1979 at Trafalgar Studios in the band's hometown of Sydney and released the following year on the band's own label. In 2022, X were celebrating the 40th (ish?) anniversary of the classic album, “X-Aspirations”, playing the whole album in it's running order.</p>
    <p>Another live multitrack recording for Craig Kember / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zenarcadeofficial/">Zen Arcade</a>. X played their album "Aspirations" in full for a coinciding 40th anniversary night.</p>

    <p>The house desk (Digico S21) had been re-patched locally earlier that day and Dazza's mic set-up was almost bare bones - so there weren't any luxuries left for the capture - however, the recordings came out sounding pretty nice, considering the sound coming off stage. See linked article for more.</p>
    <p>This was the last live capture using Protools into a macbookpro. While a wasted punter/dickhead critiqued Dazza's work, the unfounded negativity that made no dent on Daz found another way. At the very same moment, stopping record, an error popped up in tools and we lost the BV track. Sorry about that Craig!</p>
    <p>Tracks Live / Reaper has been much sturdier running from the macbook since.</p>

    <h4>ColourWheel - Test Run @ The Capitol SEP22</h4>
    <p>Jim Morginie: in THE COLOUR WHEEL, we explore the attempts over history to prove the 'connection' between music and colour - examine the art, music, and theories of Kandinsky, Klee, Schoenberg, and Bowral born artist Roy de Maistre. In the early years of the 20th century there were terrific advances in physics with the Special and General theories of Relativity and the advent of quantum mechanics, uncovering the very building blocks of matter which totally changed the way in which humans observed the world. Around the same time, a similar revolution took place in both Muisc and Art, along with a desire to deconstruct formality and structure. THE COLOUR WHEEL is performed by myself and an ensemble of electric guitar players and painters.</p>
    <p>RMIT extra-curricular fun. Midnight Oil's Jim Moginie combines music and art in - 'The Colour Wheel', a guitar orchestra exploring the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia">synesthesia</a>, putting the newly installed Capitol lighting system to good use.</p>
    <p>In anticipation of the <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/arts/midnight-oils-jim-moginie-combines-music-and-art-in-the-colour-wheel/news-story/c86503e035d663e5bcad0d63becad897">ColourWheel</a> coming to <a href="https://thecapitol.tv/">The Capitol</a> in 2023, a group of eager volunteers helped staff to put on three dry-run shows to assess the productions viability/kinks/potential.</p>

    <p>Desk: Allen & Heath SQ6. 2x large subwoofers were brought in and we patched into the Capitol's PA system. Testing the system with pink noise and an RTA showed promising signs. 
       But when really pushed, the loud stage volume caused issues with clarity of the performance. 
       The PA being set up through a Q-sys network was geared to accomodate lectures and speakers, and not so much orchestral rock <b>\m/,</b>.
       One run through was even performed without the PA, though a little underwhelming. Hopefully 2023 has a PA set-up brought in or the performers each bring a Fender Twin. </p>

    <p>In May 2022, the Astor Theatre showcased a new documentary, <a href="https://www.loveinbrightlandscapes.com/">Love In Bright Landscapes</a>. The film celebrates the late David McComb of the Triffids. The Astor Theatre presented the film in a double feature, with a Q&A and a tribute concert after the showing. <a href="https://whatsmyscene.com/snap-scene-love-in-bright-landscapes-a-tribute-to-david-mccomb-astor-theatre-15th-may-2022/">Snap Scene: Love In Bright Landscapes: A Tribute To David Mccomb, Astor Theatre, 15th May 2022</a></p>

Recording out of the X32 desk was an easy USB out, to laptop, capture using Tracks Live.</p>
    <p>Later gave an incredibly awkward interview published on RMIT's student news page: <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/news/2022/july/astor-theatre-sound-production">Sound Production student shines in new documentary</a>, the title is a little misleading..</p>
